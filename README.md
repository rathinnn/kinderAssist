# kinderAssist

The effects of the pandemic are fading, and our lives are returning to normal, but schooling appears to be going online for the foreseeable future. Despite the fact that schools are opening for students in higher grades, the younger ones will continue to be online. Children are still stuck onto their screens for online education. Teachers, particularly kindergarten teachers, are having a difficult time keeping track of their students. kinderAssist is the ideal software for assisting teachers in keeping track of their kindergarten students and ensuring that they remain engaged and focused throughout the activity.

## What it does
KinderAssist is a simple software that helps teachers of kindergarten schools to keep track of their students and help them in their activities. All the operations are done from the teachers' side and there is no need for the children to worry about. Children can focus on their activities more effectively, and the teacher will be notified in real-time if there is a problem on the child's side, even if the class is very large, so that they can help them with a one-on-one session. This is done with the help of many Machine Learning Algorithms Like Face and Hand Detection using Mediapipe.
